#George Nesca Bio (September 10, 2014)
###Brief as of Recent
With free time from  my _semi-retirement_, I volunteer at [CWB](http://cwb.org) to barter some sailing time, try to play some tennis (although the season is winding down), and just hang around doing house work. Now I'm looking for something to keep me more interested and excited on a daily basis, as well as lifelong basis. Hopefully learning Python, and other prorgramming languages, will reinvigorate enthusiam now and for future ventures... And eventually get me more disposable income to eat more [otoro](http://otoro.com/).
###Workings
I've spent most of my professional career developing RF microwave circuits and assemblies for defense and aerospace communication, navigation, and surveillance applications... From design and manufacturing, to project management and sales. In retrospect, a fairly good experience with some good moments.
###Formal Education
        *Majored in Electrical Engineering, and Minored in Business 
        *Oper. efficiencey cred: DFSS Green Belt. Almost got a Black Belt... Hiya! 
        *Hopefully Code Fellows F2 Python and Python Accelerator!
