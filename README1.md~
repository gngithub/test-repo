#George Nesca Bio (September 10, 2014)

###Brief
Recently, I've been volunteering at (CWB)[] to barter some sailing time... Trying to play more tennis... And just hanging out. Now I'm looking for something to keep me interested and excited on a daily basis, as well as lifelong basis. 
###Employment History
I was a hardware guy. Spent most of my career developing Rf microwave circuits and assemblies for defense and aerospace... From deisgn and manufacturing, to project management and sales.

###Education
*Cal Poly SLO 2001: Majored in Electrical Engineering, Minored Business (does anyone really ask for a diploma these days...)
*DFSS Green Belt through Honeywell. Almost finished Black Belt but chose another job instead of credentials.

*Even better is trying to self-educate myself for free (although hardware is never free, and neither is expert advice)!!
